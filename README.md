Repository containing my **Python** track exercises from
[Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/python) and their solutions.

> [!NOTE]
Some exercises could be solved in a more concise or clever way using
advanced Python features or one-liners.
However, the aim here is to stay faithful to the learning objectives of each challenge,
so in some cases the code is intentionally written in a more explicit, step-by-step manner.
